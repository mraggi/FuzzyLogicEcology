# FuzzyLogicEcology
Construction of a digraph based on data points from observations of ecological distributions to calculate overlaps using fuzzy logic.

To use, just do the usual:
```bash
	cd /path/to/wherever
	git clone https://github.com/mraggi/FuzzyLogicEcology.git
	cd FuzzyLogicEcology
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	./quercus_build_graph.sh
```

Of course, more detailed options can be found by typing
```bash
	./fuzzylogic --help
```
